### Overview
In this project my team built a social media site to help combat the growing issue of lonliness in elderly. The website featured many features such as communities and posting to those communities to allow users to share about common interests and learn about new ones.
My role in this project was mainly to help with managing those posts and communities, suspicious logins and customer support using Gemini

However unlike the previous project this one had a much stronger focus on application security and helped me to learn about common vulnerabilities and how to combat them using the OWASP top 10.

### Tech Stack
Backend: Python Flask
Database: SQL
Front-end: HTML, Bootstrap, Jinja2 Templating, Javascript

### Features I Made
