I did this through, with my group, building a working shopping website that had features to both make the lives of the people managing and shopping on the website easier. For this website I developed the Displaying of listings, The shopping cart, Checking out , Displaying the customers orders as well as all orders for the people running the website, Email receipts and a Chat-bot.\nIn order to do all of this I have used Python, HTML, Flask, JavaScript and Jinja to work on this project as a team. To implement more features I also had to use APIs such as Gemini for the chat bot and Pandas for creating excel sheets as well as Libraries such as Creditcard to verify credit cards.\nFeatures I made # Gemini Chat-bot Exporting customer orders to excel for data analysis Filters for any pages displaying items Cart that is session based Storage of order and product data Customers are emailed their receipts Protection from Cross-Site-Scripting Validation for forms and carts Checking images MIME type to ensure its file type Virus scanning on images uploaded Meta-Data scrubbing on images uploaded Conclusion # All these features would aim to help customers to have a smooth experience with thoughtful design as well as the people managing the website to help them to manage the place easily and also make future plans using the data that they collect through customers contacting them and order data analysis.\nThe parts I made also had an emphasis on security and redundancy which would help the managers to feel safer that they are not very prone to bugs or attacks such as cross-site-scripting.\nSkills learned Through the Features # Gemini API Pandas Python Library Managing website Sessions Shelve Python Library Flask Email WTForms library Checking file MIME type ClamAV library for Virus Scanning How to look at and remove Meta-Data ","date":"20 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/app_dev_prj/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Clothing E-commerce shop(app development project)","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/archive/","section":"Archive","summary":"All my posts","title":"Archive","type":"archive"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/all/","section":"Feed","summary":"","title":"Feed","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
