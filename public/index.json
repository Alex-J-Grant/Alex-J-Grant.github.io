I actually got an insane deal on the server I got, its a 10 year old gaming PC however for the low low price of 70 dollaridoos so pretty happy with that. It was on windows of course so I first downloaded a Ubuntu server ISO(basically a file for putting that OS on your computer) and set that all up. I then exchanged SSH keys between this server and my computer so I could work on it from my main computer(I used the ssh-copy-id command). Ill include stuff I looked at below.\nHardening SSH # Im gonna do this section in a kinda step format because im not so sure how to format it. The config file is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config btw.\nChange my port for SSH away from the default of 22 Set these configs to no PasswordAuthentication no\rPermitRootLogin no Run this command to only allow SSH connections from your IP, also make sure you install iptables-persistent for the file to save to. #Basically what its doing is making a rule for incoming connections(-A INPUT) for TCP(-p TCP) at the port of your SSH port(--dport \u0026lt;your ssh port\u0026gt;) -s from your address (-s \u0026lt;your ip address\u0026gt;)\rallow them into the SSH(-j ACCEPT) if that rule doesn\u0026#39;t happen then the same thing but don\u0026#39;t let them into the SSH(-j DROP) also save it using that last line.\rsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport \u0026lt;your ssh port\u0026gt;

For this website I developed the Displaying of listings, The shopping cart, Checking out , Displaying the customers orders as well as all orders for the people running the website, Email receipts and a Chat-bot.\nIn order to do all of this I have used Python, HTML, Flask, JavaScript and Jinja to work on this project as a team. To implement more features I also had to use APIs such as Gemini for the chat bot and Pandas for creating excel sheets as well as Libraries such as Creditcard to verify credit cards.\nFeatures I made # Gemini Chat-bot Exporting customer orders to excel for data analysis Filters for any pages displaying items Cart that is session based Storage of order and product data Customers are emailed their receipts Protection from Cross-Site-Scripting Validation for forms and carts Checking images MIME type to ensure its file type Virus scanning on images uploaded Meta-Data scrubbing on images uploaded Conclusion # All these features would aim to help customers to have a smooth experience with thoughtful design as well as the people managing the website to help them to manage the place easily and also make future plans using the data that they collect through customers contacting them and order data analysis.\nThe parts I made also had an emphasis on security and redundancy which would help the managers to feel safer that they are not very prone to bugs or attacks such as cross-site-scripting.\nSkills learned Through the Features # Gemini API Pandas Python Library Managing website Sessions Shelve Python Library Flask Email WTForms library Checking file MIME type ClamAV library for Virus Scanning How to look at and remove Meta-Data ","date":"20 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/posts/app_dev_prj/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Clothing E-commerce shop(app development project)","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hardening/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hardening","type":"tags"},{"content":" Small disclaimer # This project is currently a work in progress as I want to continue to add features to it\nOverview # This is a general cyber security project that I decided to start for fun.
